# Workshop on Awareness and Consciousness in Artificial Intelligence (ACAI)
## Description

The workshop will be held in conjunction with the 2025 ACM International Joint Conference on Pervasive and Ubiquitous Computing, from October 14-16, 2025, at Aalto University, Espoo, Finland.

## Call for papers
The pursuit of awareness and consciousness in Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been a cornerstone of research for decades, yet it remains one of the most complex and unresolved challenges. While AI systems have made remarkable strides in sensory processing, pattern recognition, and decision-making, they often lack the depth of understanding and adaptability that characterize true awareness. Real awareness involves more than just data processing—it requires context, self-monitoring, and the ability to adapt to dynamic environments. For AI, this translates to moving beyond rigid algorithms toward systems that can reason probabilistically, learn from interactions, and exhibit a form of "understanding" that aligns with human expectations.

This workshop explores the boundaries of awareness in AI, focusing on its theoretical foundations, practical applications, and societal implications. Our scope is structured around three core themes:
- Beyond Human-Centric Models: Developing new frameworks to define and measure awareness in artificial systems, moving beyond traditional human-centric perspectives. 
- Building Trust Through Awareness: Investigating how aware systems can demonstrate understanding and adaptability to foster human trust and collaboration. 
- Awareness in Action: Exploring real-world applications of aware AI, from self-monitoring smart buildings to adaptive robotics and decision-support systems.

## Topics of interest
We encourage submissions on a variety of topics, including but not limited to:
- Foundations of Artificial Awareness
  - Theories of consciousness and awareness:  Attention Schema Theory (AST), Global Neuronal Workspace (GNW), Predictive Processing, and other cognitive neuroscience models. 
  - Architectures for artificial consciousness: Computational models of awareness, memory, and decision-making.
  - Social and collective awareness: Emergent awareness in multi-agent systems, human-robot interaction, and collaborative environments. 
  - Value-Aware AI: Ethical frameworks for moral decision-making in autonomous systems.
- Sensing and Perception
  - Advanced sensing technologies: RF-based sensing (radar, WiFi, RFID), audio-based sensing, optical signal processing, and environmental monitoring.
  - Cross-modality data fusion: integrating data from multiple sensing modalities for robust perception.
  - Context-aware systems: adaptive systems that respond to environmental and user context.
- Distributed Intelligence and Self-Aware Systems
  - Distributed learning and probabilistic reasoning: techniques for enabling systems to monitor, analyze, and adapt to their surroundings.
  - Self-monitoring and self-evaluation: metacognitive models for performance monitoring and adaptation.
  - Emergent awareness in collectives: collaborative awareness in distributed systems, including robotic swarms and IoT networks.
- Applications of Aware Systems 
  - Smart environments: self-aware buildings, smart homes, and offices that adapt to user needs and sentiments. 
  - Healthcare: Health monitoring systems with contextual awareness and adaptive decision-making. 
  - Industry: Autonomous systems for industrial applications, including predictive maintenance and tool invention. 
  - Social robots and assistive technologies: Robots with social awareness and value-aligned decision-making.
- Sustainability and Ethical Considerations 
  - Energy-efficient systems: low-power embedded systems, solar-powered devices, and energy optimization techniques. 
  - Privacy and security: Secure authentication, data protection, and communication in IoT networks. 
  - Ethical AI: ensuring that aware systems align with human values and societal norms.
